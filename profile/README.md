## Hi there 👋

My name is Chino, and I'm an almost-graduate from Codam Coding College centered in Amsterdam on the Marine terrain.
You are currently looking at my portfolio containing all my Codam Core projects & tasks.

I have done several projects and I think you would like to see a few 👀

1. [So long](https://github.com/SlothsAreLazyTho-codam/so_long)
  - this project is a small game where the player has to collect every coin found in the maze and exit the game.
  - the goal of this project was to learn how to use the flood-full algortihm to validate maps.

2. [Minishell](https://github.com/SlothsAreLazyTho-codam/minishell)
  - We created our own mini bash lookalike where simple commands where created such as echo, cd and exit.
  - also things like redirections(>> / <<), and pipes (|)

For any more information, please feel free to reachout through my contact information provided in my CV submitted
